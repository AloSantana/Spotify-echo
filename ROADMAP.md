**P0 – High impact, low integration risk**

1. **Personalized “Echo Profiles” for users**
   - Add backend model for `EchoProfile` (preferred genres, tempo range, energy/valence ranges, favorite artists).
   - Add endpoints:
     - `GET /api/profile`
     - `PUT /api/profile` (update preferences, including “auto-learn from listening history” flag).
   - Wire Spotify data:
     - Background job / endpoint to pull top tracks + artists and infer profile vectors from audio features.
   - Frontend:
     - React settings panel: sliders for tempo/energy/valence, multi-select for genres, toggle for “learn from Spotify history.”
     - Persist and show a quick textual summary (“You like energetic, danceable tracks around 120–130 BPM”).

2. **EchoTune “Smart Mix” playlist generator (MVP)**
   - Backend:
     - Endpoint `POST /api/playlists/smart-mix` that:
       - Accepts: seed tracks/artists/genres, target mood (e.g., chill / focus / party), length (N tracks).
       - Uses stored EchoProfile + Spotify audio features to:
         - Filter candidate tracks by BPM, energy, etc.
         - Score tracks by similarity to user profile and requested mood.
       - Returns ordered track URIs and human-readable rationale per track.

---

## 1. Repository & Architecture Improvements

**Goal:** Make the repo cleaner, more modular, and scalable, following AI/ML repo best practices.[1]

### 1.1 Structure & Config (High)

- [ ] **Create a top-level `docs/` and `scripts/` folders** and move ad‑hoc utilities and one-off scripts into `scripts/` to reduce clutter (Copilot can assist with updating import paths).[1]  
- [ ] **Introduce central configuration management**:  
  - Add a `config/` directory with e.g. `config/default.json` or `config/*.yaml`.  
  - Refactor hardcoded parameters in backend (API keys, model paths, Spotify scopes, limits) into config + environment variables.[1]  
- [ ] **Add `.env.example` file** listing all required environment variables (Spotify credentials, DB URL, secret keys, model endpoints). Copilot can infer usage from current code.  
- [ ] **Standardize project entry points**:  
  - Ensure backend has a single `server.ts` / `main.py` (depending on stack) and a `README` section “How to run backend/frontend” with consistent commands.[1]

### 1.2 Modularization & Scalability (Medium)

- [ ] **Refactor “God files” into feature modules** (e.g., `spotify/`, `recommendation/`, `auth/`):  
  - Split large service/controller files into smaller ones (target < 300 lines per file, < 50 lines per function, where reasonable).[1]  
- [ ] **Introduce...

---

## 1. Repository & Architecture Improvements

**1.1. Standardize repo structure and configs (High)**  
- Add top-level folders: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `ml/`, `infrastructure/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`.  
- Introduce central config pattern for each service: `config.ts`/`config.py` reading from environment variables (no hard‑coded secrets/URLs).  
- Add `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore` and basic lint/format configs (ESLint + Prettier for React, flake8/black or ruff for Python).  
- Add `README.md` sections: architecture overview, folder layout, how to run dev (frontend, backend, ML), how to run tests.  

**1.2. Introduce modular “music‑engine” boundary (High)**  
- Create a `backend/music_engine/` (or `ml/engine/`) module that exposes clean functions:  
  - `analyze_track(audio_or_features)`  
  - `generate_recommendations(user_id | audio_features)`  
  - `create_playlist(seed_tracks, target_mood, target_energy)`  
- Refactor existing Spotify + ML logic into this module so frontend only hits simple REST endpoints and backend orchestrates Spotify + models through this layer.

---

## 2. Music AI/ML Enhancements

**2.1. Add pluggable model wrapper layer (High)**  
Inside `ml/`:

- Define interface (Python):  
  ```python
  class EchoTuneModel(Protocol):
      def analyze_features(self, features: dict) -> dict: ...
      def recommend_...

## 1) Repository & Architecture Improvements

**1.1. Standardize project structure (High)**  
- Create a top-level structure like:  
  - `backend/` (API, Spotify integration, AI services)  
  - `frontend/` (React app)  
  - `models/` or `ai/` (training/inference code, if separate)  
  - `scripts/` (maintenance, data prep, utilities)  
  - `tests/` (backend + frontend)  
  - `docs/`  
- Add a `README.md` at root describing this structure and entry points.[1]  
- Add `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` explaining how to run each service and how they communicate.

**1.2. Introduce modular service boundaries (Medium)**  
- Split backend into clear modules:  
  - `spotify/` (all Spotify API calls)  
  - `recommendation/` (EchoTune AI logic)  
  - `users/` (user profiles, auth, preferences)  
  - `common/` (logging, error handling, types)  
- Refactor imports to use these modules instead of cross-cutting utilities.  
- Add a lightweight architecture overview in `docs/architecture.md` using text + simple ASCII diagrams (no images needed for Copilot).

**1.3. Add environment & dependency management (High)**  
- Add `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for Python, or `package.json` cleanup for Node-based backend.[1]  
- Add `.env.example` for API keys (Spotify client ID/secret, JWT secret, etc.).  
- Ens...

## 1. Codebase Structure & Refactoring

**Goal:** Make the EchoTune AI repo easier to navigate, safer to extend, and more automation-friendly.[1]

### Tasks

1. **Standardize repository layout (Priority: High)**  
   - Create or update a top-level structure like:
     - `backend/` (API, Spotify integration, ML orchestration)
     - `frontend/` (React app)
     - `models/` or `ml/` (training, inference pipelines)
     - `scripts/` (CLI utilities, maintenance scripts)
     - `tests/` (backend + frontend tests)
     - `docs/` (architecture, API, setup)  
   - Ensure shared utilities are moved to `backend/common/` or `backend/utils/` and remove duplicate helper code.

2. **Introduce/normalize module boundaries (Priority: Medium)**  
   - Group backend modules into:
     - `services/` (Spotify, recommendation, user profiles)
     - `routes/` or `controllers/` (HTTP handlers)
     - `repositories/` (DB access if applicable)
     - `core/` (domain logic: tracks, playlists, features)  
   - Update imports to use these new module paths.

3. **Add configuration system with environment variables (Priority: High)**  
   - Create `backend/config/index.(ts|js)` that:
     - Reads env vars (Spotify keys, DB URL, model paths, etc.).
     - Performs basic validation (throw error if required env vars missing).

## 1. Codebase Structure & Refactoring

**Goal:** Make the repo easier for Copilot and humans to navigate and extend.

### Tasks

1. **Standardize project structure**  
   - [P1] Create or update a clear top-level structure:  
     - `frontend/` (React app)  
     - `backend/` (API, ML orchestration, Spotify integration)  
     - `ml/` or `models/` (music AI models, experiments)  
     - `scripts/` (utility scripts, data prep)  
     - `docs/`  
   - Ensure each subfolder has a short `README.md` explaining its purpose.

2. **Introduce/configure linting & formatting**  
   - [P1] Add ESLint + Prettier for React (TypeScript if used), with a standard config (`airbnb`, `react-app`, or similar).  
   - [P2] Add a formatter/linter for backend language (e.g., `black` + `ruff` for Python, or `eslint` for Node).  
   - [P2] Add basic pre-commit hooks (e.g., `husky` + `lint-staged` or `pre-commit` for Python) so Copilot changes get auto-formatted.

3. **Refactor large/complex files**  
   - [P1] Identify any file > 300–400 lines or with multiple responsibilities (e.g., a React page container that manages state, rendering, and API calls).  
   - Split into:  
     - **UI-only components**  
     - **hooks** (e.g., `useEchoTuneSession`, `useSpotifyPlayback`, `useTrackAnalysis`)

                ### Repository Analysis Summary
EchoTune AI's codebase, in **Cycle 3/5** with 9 total tasks completed, shows a solid foundation in music AI/ML with Spotify API integration and React frontend, but opportunities exist for professional-tier enhancements in structure, code quality, and scalability per AI/ML repository best practices[1]. GitHub Copilot can automate most suggested tasks via natural language prompts in VSCode or GitHub, leveraging its repository analysis, code explanation, refactoring suggestions, and PR reviews[3][5][6].

### 1. Current Codebase Structure Optimization
Standard AI/ML repos require logical organization (e.g., `/src`, `/docs`, `/tests`, `/notebooks`) to hit Professional tier: consistent folders, README with setup, and env specs[1]. Assume EchoTune follows monorepo with `/backend` (ML models, Spotify API), `/frontend` (React), `/data`; optimize by adding missing files like `.github/workflows` for CI/CD and `requirements.txt`/`package.json` with pinned deps.

### 2. Music AI/ML Trends Integration
2026 trends emphasize hybrid models (e.g., diffusion + transformers for music gen), real-time inference, and multimodal (audio+lyrics). Integrate via libraries like Audiocraft or MusicGen updates; Copilot can scaffold these[1].

### 3. Spotify API Usage Enhancements
Review patterns for auth (OAuth), endpoints (playlists, recommendations); enhance with caching (Redis), rate limiting, and async fetches to avoid throttling.
