I appreciate the detailed request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: I cannot conduct a comprehensive repository analysis for EchoTune AI because I don't have access to your actual codebase, project structure, or repository contents.

The search results provided focus on general best practices for repository management, AI code review tools, and dependency mapping—but they don't contain information about your specific project, its current state, or its technical architecture.

## What I Can Help With

Based on the search results, I can offer guidance on **general best practices** for repository analysis and development strategy:

**Repository Assessment Framework**[1]
The search results outline a structured approach using five critical categories:
- **Documentation** - Ensure comprehensive guides for various user types
- **Repository Structure** - Maintain consistent, logical organization
- **Environment and Dependencies** - Complete specification of requirements
- **License and Legal** - Establish proper compliance
- **Code Quality** - Implement professional standards (functions under 50 lines, type hints, docstrings, testing frameworks)[1]

**AI-Assisted Code Review Tools**[5][6]
Tools like GitHub Copilot can automatically analyze code through pattern recognition, detect issues ranging from syntax errors to security vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements in pull requests.

**Dependency Analysis**[2]
For cross-repository analysis, effective tools require context capacity (100,000+ tokens for enterprise teams), architectural understanding to recognize service boundaries, and compilation verification to predict breaking changes.

## To Proceed Effectively

To generate actionable tasks for your next coding cycle, I would need:
- Your repository's current structure and file organization
- Existing codebase metrics (lines of code, test coverage, etc.)
- Current Spotify API integration details
- React component inventory and performance metrics
- Known technical debt or architectural constraints
- Your team's capacity and skill levels

Would you like to share these details so I can provide specific, tailored recommendations?
