I appreciate your detailed request, but I need to clarify that I cannot conduct a comprehensive repository analysis for your EchoTune AI project based on the search results provided.

The search results contain general best practices for repository structure, AI code review tools, and dependency mapping—but they do not include:

- Access to your actual EchoTune AI codebase
- Your current repository structure or code metrics
- Your specific Spotify API implementation details
- Your React component architecture
- Your existing testing framework or security posture
- Your project roadmap or technical constraints

**What the search results do support:**

The provided sources outline frameworks for evaluating repositories across five categories: **Documentation, Repository Structure, Environment and Dependencies, License and Legal, and Code Quality**[1]. They also describe AI-assisted code review tools (GitHub Copilot, Qodo, CodeGuru) that can analyze code patterns, detect issues, and suggest improvements[4][6].

**To proceed effectively, you would need to:**

1. **Provide your repository** for direct analysis, or share specific code samples, architecture diagrams, and current metrics
2. **Use AI code review tools** like GitHub Copilot or Qodo integrated into your GitHub workflow to automatically analyze your codebase and generate pull request suggestions[4]
3. **Apply the three-tier framework** (Essential, Professional, Elite) to assess your current repository against established standards[1]
4. **Implement dependency mapping tools** if you need to understand cross-repository relationships at scale[2]

If you'd like, I can help you understand how to structure a repository assessment process or explain best practices for specific aspects of your project—but I cannot generate actionable tasks without access to your actual codebase.
