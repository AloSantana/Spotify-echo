I appreciate your detailed request, but I need to clarify that the search results provided don't contain information specific to EchoTune AI, its codebase, Spotify API integration, React components, or your project's current state.

The search results cover general best practices for AI/ML repositories, AI code review tools, and repository analysis approaches—but they don't include access to your actual repository, codebase metrics, or project-specific data needed to conduct a genuine comprehensive analysis.

To provide the actionable analysis you're requesting, I would need:

- **Direct access to your EchoTune AI repository** to evaluate current structure, dependencies, and code quality
- **Your project documentation** outlining current architecture and technical decisions
- **Specific metrics** on Spotify API usage patterns and performance data
- **Frontend performance profiling data** from your React components
- **Your existing roadmap and feature backlog** to identify gaps
- **Security audit results** or vulnerability assessments

**What I can offer based on the search results:**

The sources suggest a framework for evaluating repositories across five categories: Documentation, Repository Structure, Environment and Dependencies, License and Legal, and Code Quality[1]. For your next cycle, you could use this framework to systematically assess your repository against Professional or Elite standards[1].

Additionally, AI code reviewers integrated with GitHub can help automate detection of security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and performance bottlenecks[4][6], which could support your development workflow.

To generate the specific, prioritized tasks you need, please provide access to your repository or share detailed information about your current codebase, architecture, and performance metrics.
