# AWS Bedrock Live Validation - Trigger File

This file exists to trigger the bedrock-validation workflow.

**Last updated:** 2025-01-15

## Workflow Status

The AWS Bedrock Live Validation workflow should trigger on:
- Push to branches matching `copilot/fix-*`
- Pull requests to `main` that modify validation-related files
- Manual workflow dispatch

## Recent Updates

- Added AWS SDK as production dependency
- Improved workflow error reporting
- Added credential validation in workflow
- Removed path filters to ensure workflow runs on every push

## Next Steps

This push should trigger the workflow automatically. Check:
1. GitHub Actions tab for "AWS Bedrock Live Validation" workflow
2. Workflow logs for actual Bedrock API calls
3. AWS CloudWatch for invocation logs
4. AWS Cost Explorer for charges

If the workflow doesn't run, manually trigger it via:
- Actions → AWS Bedrock Live Validation → Run workflow
