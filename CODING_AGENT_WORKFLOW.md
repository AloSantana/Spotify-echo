# CODING AGENT WORKFLOW

## Fresh Start Goal

The goal of this repository is to provide coding agents with a structured workflow to tackle projects effectively and efficiently.

## Workflow
- **Analyze**: Evaluate the requirements and constraints of the project.
- **Plan**: Develop a robust plan that outlines the steps to achieve the project goals.
- **Execute**: Implement the plan with coding best practices.
- **Verify**: Test and validate the implementation to ensure quality and functionality.

## Repository Structure
- **src/**: Contains all source files.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation related to the project.

This workflow should guide agents throughout the development process, ensuring that each phase is carefully considered and executed.
