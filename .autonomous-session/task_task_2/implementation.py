# Task: TypeScript Migration Plan for High-Change Backend Modules
# Description: Draft and commit a migration plan for converting backend modules with high change-rate (e.g., src/api/routes/*, src/chat/*) to TypeScript. The plan should include file-by-file migration order, type safety priorities, and CI integration steps.
# Files to modify: ['MIGRATION_PLAN.md', 'src/api/routes/*', 'src/chat/*']

print("Implementing: TypeScript Migration Plan for High-Change Backend Modules")

# Implementation steps would go here
# For now, create a placeholder implementation
