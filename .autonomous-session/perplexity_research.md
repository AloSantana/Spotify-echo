### ⚡ Performance Optimization Opportunities

- **MongoDB Advanced Indexing**  
  - Implement compound and TTL indexes for analytics and telemetry data to improve query speed and data rotation[6].  
  - *Complexity*: 4

- **Streaming & Caching Enhancements**  
  - Optimize backend for response streaming (large datasets) and frontend for client-side caching of music assets and analytics[6].  
  - *Complexity*: 5

- **Docker Multi-Stage Builds**  
  - Refine Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds, reducing image size and improving CI/CD pipeline efficiency.  
  - *Complexity*: 4
