{"actionable_tasks": [], "analysis_text": "I cannot provide the analysis you've requested because the EchoTune AI project roadmap you've shared is not present in the search results provided to me. The search results contain information about general AI roadmaps for 2026, enterprise AI implementation strategies, and AI engineering learning paths\u2014but they do not include any documentation specific to the EchoTune AI project.\n\nTo deliver an accurate, actionable analysis with the JSON structure you've specified, I would need:\n\n1. **The actual EchoTune roadmap document** with complete task listings, file structures, and implementation details\n2. **Current codebase context** (repository structure, existing test coverage, dependency versions)\n3. **Specific constraints** (team size, deployment environment, external API availability)\n\n**What I can offer instead:**\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide general guidance on **prioritizing incomplete development tasks** for music AI applications in 2026, which would include:\n\n- **Performance optimization** (reducing API response time from ~400ms to <200ms)[2]\n- **Test coverage expansion** (increasing from 45% to 70%+)[2]\n- **TypeScript migration** for type safety in high-change modules[2]\n- **Real-time features** like collaborative playlists using WebSocket patterns[3]\n- **AI transparency labeling** to comply with 2026 streaming platform mandates[5]\n\nIf you can share the complete EchoTune roadmap document or clarify which specific sections you'd like analyzed, I can provide the detailed JSON response with actionable tasks, implementation steps, and complexity scoring."}
