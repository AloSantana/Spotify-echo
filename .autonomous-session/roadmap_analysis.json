{"actionable_tasks": [], "analysis_text": "I cannot analyze the EchoTune AI project roadmap you've provided because it was not included in the search results I received. The search results contain information about general AI roadmaps for 2026, enterprise AI strategies, and educational AI projects, but they do not reference or contain the specific EchoTune AI roadmap document you're asking me to analyze.\n\nTo provide the actionable development tasks and JSON response you've requested, I would need:\n\n1. **The complete EchoTune roadmap document** with all sections visible (your query appears to be truncated after \"M1 \u2014 Provider Registry & Switching (COMPLETE)\")\n2. **Current project state documentation** (ROADMAP_AUTO.md, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md, WORKFLOW_STATE.md)\n3. **Codebase context** (file structure, current test coverage details, specific vulnerability reports)\n\n**What I can suggest instead:**\n\nBased on the general 2026 AI development trends in the search results, typical high-impact, quick-win tasks for music AI projects like EchoTune would include[2]:\n\n- **Performance optimization** (reducing API response times from 400ms to <200ms target)\n- **Test coverage expansion** (increasing from 45% to 70%+)\n- **Security hardening** (addressing remaining vulnerabilities from audits)\n- **Monitoring implementation** (p50/p95 latency tracking)\n\n**To get a proper analysis, please:**\n\n- Share the complete, untruncated roadmap document\n- Clarify which sections are incomplete or need prioritization\n- Specify any constraints (team size, deployment timeline, resource availability)\n\nI'm ready to provide the detailed JSON response with specific implementation steps once I have the full project context."}
