{"actionable_tasks": [], "analysis_text": "I cannot provide the analysis you've requested because the EchoTune AI project roadmap you've shared appears to be a document you've created or have access to, but it was not included in my search results. My role is to synthesize information from provided search results to answer queries, and I don't have access to external files, repositories, or documents outside of what's explicitly provided to me.\n\nTo help you effectively, I would need you to:\n\n1. **Paste the complete roadmap content** directly into your query, including all sections, tasks, and status indicators\n2. **Clarify the specific analysis focus** \u2014 for example, are you looking for:\n   - Tasks that align with 2026 AI engineering trends?\n   - Quick wins that can be implemented this week?\n   - Dependencies between tasks that should be prioritized?\n   - Integration opportunities with emerging AI/ML frameworks?\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like general guidance on **actionable development tasks for AI music applications in 2026**, I can provide that based on current industry trends in AI engineering, music tech, and production-ready systems. The search results I have access to cover AI roadmaps for 2026, including topics like:\n\n- **LLM integration and multi-provider failover strategies**[1][2]\n- **Production-grade AI system design**[1]\n- **Real-world AI application architecture**[2]\n- **Agentic AI and multi-agent systems**[5]\n\nWould you like me to synthesize recommendations based on these 2026 AI engineering trends instead, or would you prefer to share the full roadmap document for detailed analysis?"}
