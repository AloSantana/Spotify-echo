{"actionable_tasks": [], "analysis_text": "I cannot analyze the EchoTune AI project roadmap you've provided because it was not included in the search results I received. The search results contain information about general AI roadmaps for 2026, enterprise AI strategies, and AI engineering learning paths, but they do not reference or contain the specific EchoTune project documentation you're asking me to evaluate.\n\nTo provide the actionable development tasks analysis you're requesting, I would need:\n\n1. The actual EchoTune roadmap document with its complete task list and specifications\n2. Current project structure and codebase details\n3. Specific constraints or dependencies relevant to your implementation environment\n\n**What I can offer instead:**\n\nBased on the search results about 2026 AI development trends, I can suggest general high-impact areas for music AI projects:\n\n- **Performance optimization**: The search results emphasize that enterprises should target <200ms API response times and >90 Lighthouse scores[2], which aligns with your stated targets\n- **Testing expansion**: Industry guidance recommends increasing test coverage to >70%[2], matching your Q1 2026 goal\n- **Production-grade architecture**: Focus on MLOps pipelines, monitoring, and governance rather than just model development[2]\n- **AI transparency**: 2026 trends highlight the importance of AI-generated content labeling and explainability[1][5]\n\nIf you'd like me to analyze your EchoTune roadmap, please share the complete document content, and I'll provide the structured JSON response with specific, actionable development tasks."}
