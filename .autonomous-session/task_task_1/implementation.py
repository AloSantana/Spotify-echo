# Task: Implement p50/p95 API latency tracking for Performance Monitoring
# Description: Extend the existing performance monitoring (currently 40% complete) to record and expose p50 and p95 latency for key backend endpoints and provider calls, aligned with the API Response Time p95 target.
# Files to modify: ['src/monitoring/performanceMetrics.js', 'src/server/middleware/requestTiming.js', 'src/api/routes/metrics.js', 'docs/metrics.md']

# Implementation steps would go here
# For now, create a placeholder implementation
