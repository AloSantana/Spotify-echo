# Task: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern for Provider Failover
# Description: Add a circuit breaker mechanism to the backend provider switching logic to automatically failover when a provider is unhealthy. This improves reliability and resilience for multi-provider LLM support.
# Files to modify: ['src/api/providers.js', 'src/api/utils/circuitBreaker.js', 'src/chat/pipeline.js']
