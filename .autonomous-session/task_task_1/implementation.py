# Task: Persist Rolling Window Metrics to Redis
# Description: Implement logic to persist API latency and error metrics (rolling window) to Redis for durability and multi-instance aggregation. This will allow metrics to survive restarts and be shared across horizontally scaled instances.
# Files to modify: ['scripts/bench/api-latency.js', 'src/api/middleware/metrics.js', 'src/utils/redis.js']

# Implementation steps would go here
# For now, create a placeholder implementation
