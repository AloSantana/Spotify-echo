# Task: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern for Provider Failover
# Description: Add a circuit breaker mechanism to the backend provider selection logic to automatically failover to a healthy provider when the current one is unresponsive or error-prone. This improves system resilience and reliability.
# Files to modify: ['src/providers/providerManager.js', 'src/providers/index.js', 'src/utils/circuitBreaker.js', 'test/providers/circuitBreaker.test.js']
