# Task: Implement p50/p95 Latency Tracking for Performance Monitoring
# Description: Extend the existing basic performance monitoring to record and expose p50 and p95 API response times so they can be compared against the <200ms p95 target.
# Files to modify: ['src/monitoring/performanceMetrics.js', 'src/api/middleware/requestTiming.js', 'src/dashboard/components/PerformancePanel.tsx or .jsx']

print("Implementing: Implement p50/p95 Latency Tracking for Performance Monitoring")

# Implementation steps would go here
# For now, create a placeholder implementation
