# Task: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern for Provider Failover
# Description: Add a circuit breaker mechanism to the backend provider selection logic to automatically failover to a healthy provider when the current one is unresponsive or error-prone. This increases system reliability and is research-derived from the Perplexity sweep.
# Files to modify: ['src/providers/providerManager.js', 'src/providers/circuitBreaker.js', 'src/api/routes/providers.js']
